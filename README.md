# Advent of Code 2023

**Introduction**

Welcome to my repository for Advent of Code 2023. https://adventofcode.com/2023

Advent of Code is an annual coding event where participants solve a series of programming puzzles throughout December 1st to 25th. Each day brings a new challenge that tests different aspects of programming and problem-solving skills.


**Repository Structure**

This repository is organized by day, with each day's challenge having its own folder or file. Here's what you can expect in each:

    day 1/: Input data and solution for Day 1 challenge
    day 2/: Input data and solution for Day 2 challenge
    ...
    day 25/: Input data and solution for Day 25 challenge



**Languages and Tools**

The solutions in this repository are primarily written in Python. 



**Learning and Development**

Participating in Advent of Code is more than just a coding exercise. It's an opportunity to improve problem-solving skills, learn new programming techniques, and engage with a global community of programmers.



**Usage**

These solutions are primarily for my own learning and record-keeping. If you have questions or want to discuss any of the challenges, don't hesitate to reach out.
